**Editing**
If you wish to edit the priority list you will need to go into each of the triggers in 
JobPrioLoop and change the numbers assigned to them there The lower the number the Higher the Prio
Example if you wanted Reaper to always be last you would change it from 01 to 19 and change GNB from 19 to 01
The 0's are important for the single digit numbers so do not forget them (01-09) all Prio should have 2 numbers.
Their should only be one of each set of numbers.
